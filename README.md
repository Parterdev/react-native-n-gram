# ⚛️React Native Project

This project was created with [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) template.


## Description
This project is a practical code challenge that includes:
 - react native v0.65.1
 - [react-native-testing-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library) - (to make unit test over components and elements)
 - I used things like custom hooks, components, etc.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run special commands like this:

To install dependencies 
### `$ yarn install` / `$ npm install`

<br>

## To start the development server and run app on simulator or device

### `$ npx react-native run-android`

### `$ npx react-native run-ios`

<br>

## To run tests (4 in total)

### `$ yarn test`

<br>

### ⚠ Don't forget this: The result of the algorithm is rendered in a console.log().
